				<h2>Welcome to the personal site of Kelly Clarke</h2>
				<p>Hello! I graduated from Chapman University in 2014 with a B.S. in Business Entrepreneurship and a Minor in Leadership. </p>
				<p>My passions are everything having to do with entrepreneurship and startups. From a young age, I have been ingrained in the startup culture and the fast paced lifestyle.</p>
				<p>When not heads down working, my passion is traveling, learning about new cultures, trying new food and planning events. However, come basketball season, you can find me, an outspoken fan of the Golden State Warriors, driving around town with my flags or the decorations hung in my office.</p>
