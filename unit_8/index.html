				<h2>Welcome to the personal site of Kelly Clarke</h2>
				<p>I graduated from Chapman University with a Bachelor of Sciences in Business Entrepreneurship and a Minor in Leadership.  I have worked for various companies, overseeing multiple products and various business projects in an organized, effective and time efficient manner. In my most recent position, the CEO of the company referred to me as his “ultimate Swiss Army Knife,” a go-getter and ready to take on a challenge.</p>
				<p>I have experience working with companies such as Microsoft and Inc. on high volume, complex projects. I have surrounded myself by start-ups for over nine years and have the ability to wear “many hats,” think outside the box, consistently come up with creative and innovative ideas that will help the project and ultimately the business successfully move forward. I am driven, detail-oriented, organized, can quickly adapt, personable and an excellent communicator. I love working with others and accomplishing goals set forth as a team.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>When not heads down working, my passion is traveling, learning about new cultures, trying new food and planning events. However, come basketball season, you can find me cheering on my Golden State Warriors and driving around town with flags on my car.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>I can't wait to speak with you!</p>
